Pneumonia Detection using Artificail Intelligence - Convolution Neural Network:
This repo has multiple models to read, learn and predict Pneumonia
- VGG16
- incpetion
- MobileNet
- Loading an external Covid Model

All the above models have give very good Train and Validation Accuracy.
Initially all the above models were constantly stuck at accuracy levels between 48-56% and just did not improve.
We tried all the above model classes - and even tried models published by quite a few github repos.
After tuning all the hyperparameters, we have started seeing higher levels of accuracy especially with MobileNet and IncpetionV3 models

The bounding box of the affected parts of the lungs is modelled using MobileNet Regressor.
